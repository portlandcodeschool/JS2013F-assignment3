#Javascript Assignment 3

##Portland Codeschool -  Fall 2013 

####Instructions
Remember: You are working in a group repository this week. Be careful not to destroy other people's work

1. Clone (you don't need to fork) this repo to your local computer.

2. Create a directory with the same name as your last name.

3. Do all your work in the directory you've created. Do not modify any files outside of your directory.

4. Copy f2c.js from the repository root into your directory and complete the file.

5. The challenge assignment for this week is romnum.js. You should attempt it after finishing f2c.js. To begin, copy romnum.js to your working directory and edit the file.

6. If anyone is able to successfully complete f2c.js and romnum.js, you will unlock the uber-challenge assignment, which is a hardy test of vigor and wit!

7. Let me know if you have any questions!

####f2c.js

The goal here is complete two functions. One will convert celsius to fahrenheit, the other will convert fahrenheit to celsius. When you're done your output should look like this:

```
86 degrees Fahrenheit is 30 degrees Celsius
86 degrees Celsius is 186.8 degrees Fahrenheit
35 degrees Celsius is a pretty hot day!
Water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
```

####romnum.js

This assignment is significantly more challenging. You need to implement two functions. One will convert a decimal number (Number type) to a roman numeral string. The other will convert a roman numeral string to a decimal number (Number type).

Pay close attention to the comments in the file about where to put things. I've included some code for me to use to test your work. You shouldn't need to change it.
